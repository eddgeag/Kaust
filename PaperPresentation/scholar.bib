	abstract = {Technologies for profiling samples using different omics platforms have been at the forefront since the human genome project. Large-scale multi-omics data hold the promise of deciphering different regulatory layers. Yet, while there is a myriad of bioinformatics tools, each multi-omics analysis appears to start from scratch with an arbitrary decision over which tools to use and how to combine them. It is therefore an unmet need to conceptualize how to integrate such data and to implement and validate pipelines in different cases. We have designed a conceptual framework (STATegra), aiming it to be as generic as possible for multi-omics analysis, combining machine learning component analysis, non-parametric data combination and a multi-omics exploratory analysis in a step-wise manner. While in several studies we have previously combined those integrative tools, here we provide a systematic description of the STATegra framework and its validation using two TCGA case studies. For both, the Glioblastoma and the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma cases, we demonstrate an enhanced capacity to identify features in comparison to single-omics analysis. Such an integrative multi-omics analysis framework for the identification of features and components facilitates the discovery of new biology. Finally, we provide several options for applying the STATegra framework when parametric assumptions are fulfilled, and for the case when not all the samples are profiled for all omics. The STATegra framework is built using several tools, which are being integrated step-by-step as OpenSource in the STATegRa Bioconductor package https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/STATegra.html.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Single cell high throughput genomic measurements are revolutionizing the fields of biology and medicine, providing a means to tackle biological problems that have thus far been inaccessible, such as the systematic discovery of new cell types, the identification of cellular heterogeneity in health and disease, or the cell-fate decisions taking place during differentiation and reprogramming. Recently implemented multi–omics measurements of genomes, transcriptomes, epigenomes, proteomes and chromatin organization are opening up new avenues to begin to disentangle the causal relationship between -omics layers and how these co-determine higher-order cellular phenotypes. This technological revolution is not restricted to basic science but promises major breakthroughs in medical diagnostics and treatments. In this paper we review existing computational methods for the analysis and integration of different -omics layers and discuss what new approaches are needed to leverage the full potential of single cell multi-omics data.}

The most well-known source of latent variation in genomic experiments are batch effects—when samples are processed on different days, in different groups or by different people. However, there are also a large number of other variables that may have a major impact on high-throughput measurements. Here we describe the sva package for identifying, estimating and removing unwanted sources of variation in high-throughput experiments. The sva package supports surrogate variable estimation with the sva function, direct adjustment for known batch effects with the ComBat function and adjustment for batch and latent variables in prediction problems with the fsva function.Availability: The R package sva is freely available from http://www.bioconductor.org.Contact:jleek@jhsph.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.
