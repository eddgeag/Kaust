# Extending STATegRa multi-omic integration package to single-cell. KAUST project.

## Under the supervision of

Ph.D Nuria Planell
Ph.D David Cabrero


## Work Plan

STATegra is an integrative framework developed during the proliferation of multi-omic data-sets and their associated challenges. The current challenges are similar but exported to single-cell profiling. To this end, the idea is to investigate the future of the STATegra package in the context of single-cell multi-omics.

## Main Goals

Understand the workflow of STATegRa. 

### Sub goals

* From <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0696-0#data-availability> I take 2 data-sets. RNA-seq and CHIP-seq

* Implement an exploratory analysis on the 2 data-sets.

* Implement STATegRa on both data-sets.
